THIS ARBITRATION CONTRACT IS MADE PURSUANT TO A\r\n        TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND ITS INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION,\r\n        ENFORCEMENT AND PROCEEDINGS HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL\r\n        ARBITRATION ACT (\"FAA\").\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        The following procedures shall apply:\r\n        <br />\r\n        In the event a party elects to proceed with binding arbitration, it\r\n        shall provide written notice thereof to the other party by registered or\r\n        certified mail and shall describe in such notice, with reasonable\r\n        particularity, the nature and basis of such claim and the total amount\r\n        of the claim. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the\r\n        party receiving notice of a claim shall provide a written response\r\n        which, with reasonable particularity, sets forth its position concerning\r\n        the claim. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute arising from\r\n        the claim by good faith negotiations to be conducted within the thirty\r\n        (30)-day period following the written response, either of them may\r\n        initiate binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions set\r\n        forth herein. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute\r\n        Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer\r\n        Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration\r\n        Association (“AAA”) and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is\r\n        unavailable or refuses to arbitrate the parties’ dispute for any reason,\r\n        the arbitration shall be administered and conducted by a\r\n        widely-recognized arbitration organization that is mutually agreeable to\r\n        the parties, but neither party shall unreasonably withhold their\r\n        consent. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org. Unless\r\n        otherwise agreed, the arbitration shall take place in Arlington County,\r\n        Virginia, but may proceed telephonically in the event the total amount\r\n        of the claim does not exceed $2,500 U.S. dollars (if the claimant so\r\n        chooses).\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION TERMS, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO\r\n        GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. In arbitration, a\r\n        dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators,\r\n        rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal than a\r\n        court trial; however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a\r\n        court can award.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        Separate and apart from these Terms to arbitrate set forth above, the\r\n        parties hereby independently waive any right to bring or participate in\r\n        any class action in any way related to, or arising from, this Terms. You\r\n        acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to\r\n        the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable\r\n        from the Terms to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action\r\n        waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’\r\n        Terms to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY\r\n        AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION TERMS, WHICH CONTAINS THIS CLASS ACTION\r\n        WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST HER PLAN, ITS AGENTS,\r\n        OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES,\r\n        PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND/OR ASSIGNS IN AN INDIVIDUAL\r\n        CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS\r\n        ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

If any provision(s) is found to be\r\n        contrary to law, then such provision(s) will be construed, as nearly as\r\n        possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties with the other\r\n        provisions remaining in full force and effect.
